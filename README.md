*"This service was created in the context of OpenAgri project (https://horizon-openagri.eu/). OpenAgri has received funding from the EUâ€™s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement no. 101134083."*


The objective of the OpenAgri Dashboard is to act as a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) that will serve the needs of the farmers/advisors. The offered functionalities will be based on the combined use of the core OpenAgri services e.g. farm calendar, reporting service, weather service, irrigation service and pest and disease management service.


The OpenAgri Dashboard ensures a quick, seamless, and engaging user experience. In more details, the OpenAgri Dashboard will: 

 - Deliver a smooth UX even in poor network conditions. 
 - Will work offline, load quickly, and feel like native mobile apps
 - Perform faster load times, better user engagement, and no need for users to download an app from the store. 


The technology selected for the development of the GUI complies with [Progressive Web App](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/getting-started-pwa) (PWA) type of web applications that native app-like experience to users, using web technologies. This ensures maximum compatibility with desktop, tablets and smart phones with reduced development effort.  
Progressive web apps are typically built on top of web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and on top of joint open-source projects, such as React Native and Angular Ionic. 
In the case of the OpenAgri project the React open-source front-end JavaScript library will be used. It should be noted that React supports the development of PWA.
